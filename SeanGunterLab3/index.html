        <h1>Doom (1993)</h1>
        <img src="assets/images/Doom1.jpg" alt="Doom1" width="100%">
        <p>Doom 1 is the first game in the Doom series. The series revolved around playing as a marine known as the "Doom Guy" or "Doom Slayer".
        The goal in the game is to try and defend off a hellish invasion of demons and save humanity.
        It all started in 1992 when creators Id software had finished developing their new engine, the Doom Engine.
        Developer and programmer John Carmack wanted to create a 3D engine that was fast enough to be able to play games. He managed to accomplish this by restricting the 
        gameplay and viewpoint to a single plane. While Doom isn't the first first-person shooter, it was so influential that all subsequent games like it were 
        called Doom-Clones. Even though the term Doom-Clones isn't used today, it's legacy will forever live on in the term first-person shooter.

        <h1>Doom2 (1994)</h1>
        <img src="assets/images/Doom2.jpg" alt="Doom2" width="100%">
        <p>Doom2 came shortly after the first one, being released only a year later.
           The biggest differences from Doom and Doom 2 is that the game featured larger more expanisve levels, new enemies, and a new weapon was added, the super shotgun.
           The super shotgun is notorious in Doom and is probably the most iconic weapon in the series. In terms of overall gameplay though, nothing much was really changed
           and most of the development time was spent on beefing up the engine to allow for larger and more intricate levels. The overall reception of Doom 2 was extremely positive,
           where the vast majority of fans and critics believed that the game added on the already good aspects of the game and made them better.

        <h1>Doom64 (1997)</h1>
        <img src="assets/images/Doom64.jpg" alt="Doom64" width="100%">
        <p>Doom64 is the third main game in the series and was released a year after Final Doom in 1996. It was developed by Midway Games and was supervised
            by game studo Id software. As the name suggests, Doom64 was released on the Nintendo 64. One of the big differences of Doom64 and its predecessors is that the 
            games environments were created using 3D polygon models instead of using 2D sprites. Despite this, the game still used 2D sprites to represent the player character, 
            all of their weapons, and all of the enemies. The game also features all of the weapons and enemies from Doom2 but with all new sprites, mechanics, and sound effects. 
            This was also the first main series Doom game to have a new Hud.

        <h1>Doom3 (2004)</h1>
        <img src="assets/images/Doom3.jpg" alt="Doom3" width="100%">
        <p>After 7 years, Id software developed a new Doom game, Doom 3. Doom 3 was the first fully 3D modeled Doom game and it also differed when it cames to gameplay and atmosphere.
            Id decided they wanted Doom 3 to be more narrative focused and less around the gameplay. They did this by including more friendly NPCs that gave dialogue around the story.
            Before Doom 3, this wasn't something that the series was known for. The game is also considered to be a survival horror first-person shooter and had less of a focus on
            fast paced intense action. Despite all of the changes, Doom 3 was a not only a critical success, but also a commercial success. The game sold more that 3.5 million copies
            and is the most successfull game that Id has developed to date. The massive changes to gameplay didnt come withou't critique of course and many of the hardcore
            Doom fans were disappointed in the change of atmosphere and overall feel of the game.
